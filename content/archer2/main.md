In order to get an account, a potential user needs to know our project code (e281)

Users can
register at the same time for an account on the admin website SAFE, and on the 
service machine. They need both. 

Full guidance can be found at 
https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/quick-start/quickstart-users/

- Go to: https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/signup.jsp 
- Fill in the personal details
- Click submit

Now the user will be asked to accept the Terms and Conditions of Access by 
clicking the appropriate button. After this, they will get an acknowledgment, 
and an email with their password to the admin website. They should change this 
password as soon as possible. 

- Request an ARCHER2 login account in e281

See https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/quick-start/quickstart-users/#request-an-archer2-login-account for step by step guidance

For the user’s account on the service machine to 
be created this will need to be authorised by the Plasma HEC Chair.

If you are a PDRA, PhD student or on a Fellowship, i.e. not academic staff, 
then before your account is authorised a member of academic staff who is an 
HEC member in your group needs to send an email to
[HEC Consortium](mailto:d.dickinson@york.ac.uk?Subject=HEC%20Consortium)
briefly explaining your project, and stating your current job and employer.
This email only needs to be a few sentences. For academics, and researchers in
CCFE or RAL, your account can be authorised without such an email.

## Acceptable Use Policy

The Plasma HEC has an [Acceptable Use Policy](/policy) which details
the maximum job size allowed in the e281 general account along with
rules regarding disk space management. This must be read and followed
rigorously or accounts will be suspended. Along with rules on using
ARCHER2 this policy also includes details of acknowledgement. **Papers
published which used the HEC ARCHER2 allocation must acknowledge the
Plasma HEC Consortium EPSRC grant numbers EP/L000237/1
(01/05/2013--30/04/2018), EP/R029148/1 (01/05/2018--31/12/2022) and
EP/X035336/1 (01/01/2023--) as appropriate.** Publications, i.e. those
with the correct acknowledgement, from previous HEC allocations will
be used as one of the criteria from project renewals and new projects.

## Projects

All users will by default have access to the e281 account. This has a
small allocation of resources and is just for testing compilation and
small runs prior to users been allocated to a project. All new users
must check the [Acceptable Use Policy](/policy) which details the
maximum job size allowed in the e281 general account along with rules
regarding disk space management. This must be read and followed
rigorously or accounts will be suspended. For substantial use of
ARCHER2 you must be part of a project. Project time must be requested
as set out below or you must request to join an existing project. Once
in a project you can run simulations which will be charged against
that project’s allocation. Multiple requests for projects in similar
areas, or using the same code, may be joined to keep allocations
simple. So for example if you join the project e281-example then your
submission scripts must then use e281-example and NOT e281.

## Joining an existing project

It is very common that new users wish to join an existing project,
e.g. to work with a colleague or supervisor who has already been
allocated a project.  To be allowed to join an existing project the PI
of the project must send an email to [New Project
Member](mailto:d.dickinson@.ac.uk?Subject=HEC%20Consortium) stating
the uid and full name of the new member.  It is the PI’s
responsibility to ensure that the new users understands how to use the
resource.
