In addition to the rules and regulations applying to the use of ARCHER to 
which you will have agreed when registering the Plasma HEC Consortium also 
insists users follow the following guidelines.

- Our allocation of disk space on /work is limited. Our only choice is to 
  ensure /work is free for running jobs. Therefore when your job is completed 
  as soon as possible data must be removed from /work. This can be by copying 
  to the RDF store for example. Details of the RDF store are on the ARCHER web 
  pages.

- In relation to disk use it is the responsibility of the project leaders to 
  ensure a sensible disk use and visualisation strategy is in place. This can 
  mean optimising MPI-IO correctly or ensuring visualisation tools which work 
  on RDF, not just /work, are used. If needed some limited help is available 
  from Plasma-HEC support staff at Warwick and Daresbury/RAL. If continued 
  excessive use of /home persists the project may be suspended until a the code 
  IO and visualation tools are rewritten.

- The default e281 account on ARCHER is for testing and scaling analysis 
  only. Not for production jobs. Therefore the largest job which can be 
  submitted to this project is 128 CPU hours.

- Evidence may be required for grant renewal that the codes have been 
  optimised for ARCHER. Courses exist on profilers and optimizing codes. It is 
  the PIs resposibility to ensure appropriate measures are taken to optimiser 
  their code.

- Papers published which used the HEC ARCHER allocation must acknowledge the 
  Plasma HEC Consortium EPSRC grant numbers EP/L000237/1 and EP/R029148/1. 
  Papers which do not reference this grant may be ineligble as outputs for 
  renewal of the HEC allocation in March 2020 so this is important.

- Any published work which benefited from the CoSeC support from STFC must 
  acknowledge this on posters, talks and papers. Add the following to 
  acknowledgments “This work made use of computational support by CoSeC, the 
  Computational Science Centre for Research Communities, through 
  CCP-Plasma/Plasma-HEC”

Repeat offenders will have their accounts suspended. This policy is essential 
so that our allocation can be used fairly by all members.

Plasma-HEC and CCP-Plasma acknowledge the funding support it receives from 
EPSRC through CoSeC within STFC’s Scientific Computing Department.
