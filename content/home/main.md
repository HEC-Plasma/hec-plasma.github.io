The Plasma High-end Computing (HEC) Consortium is an EPSRC funded collaboration
of UK plasma physics researchers. The Plasma HEC supports research in the
simulation of high-temperature plasmas, including those plasmas of relevance to
magnetic confinement fusion, laser-plasma interactions, and laser fusion
energy. The software development includes a commitment to optimizing key codes,
with input from EPCC, Daresbury and Warwick Computer Science, and developing
new physics packages as required to maintain the UKâ€™s role in laser-plasma
physics and all approaches to fusion for energy. The consortium supports
meetings and software development. It also manages a block allocation of
national super-computer time to be used for plasma physics research.
